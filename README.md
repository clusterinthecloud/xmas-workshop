# Christmas-in-the-Cloud workshop

## Thursday 10th + Friday 11th December 2020

This is a two-day online hands-on workshop delivered in partnership
with the Bristol RSE group and AWS. This is aimed at Research Software Engineers
and Researchers with the goals of;

* learning how to port and optimise applications for the cloud
* learn how to use cloud technologies, such as terraform, deploy 
  software-defined infrastructure
* to get real, hands-on experience of developing and deploying
  cloud applications in partnership with experienced
  RSEs and AWS solutions architects

Attendees will be given free AWS accounts during the workshop, with 
plenty of free credits to support all of the hackathons and break-out
groups that will take place. Understanding software-defined hardware 
and infrastructure-as-code are valuable skills. They will enable
you to bridge from software to hardware, and to build applications
that match hardware to software. This workshop will have provide 
real valuable hands-on experience of deploying and developing cloud 
applications. You will gain useful knowledge of cross-platform tools 
such as terraform and ansible, as well as exploring the potential 
of the AWS Cloud API. 

Places are limited, so if you are interested then please sign up
soon. The workshop is free for Research Software Engineers or 
Researchers working in academia or the public sector.

The workshop will feature a small number of talks that will set
the scene for a number of hackathons. These will be based on top
of [Cluster-in-the-Cloud](https://cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io),
a solution that simplifies the creation of on-demand HPC clusters
in the cloud.

## Day 1 - Running your applications on Cloud HPC

Work with Bristol RSEs and AWS Solutions Architects to port and benchmark 
applications that matter to you to the cloud. You will get full access
to a range of different processors, including AWS's ARM64 Gravitons. 
We will help you compile and optimise your applications for these processors,
with the aim of benchmarking the code, and optimising price/performance
by choosing the right processor for your workload. You will also become
more familiar with cluster-in-the-cloud, and will see how easy it is
to deploy and manage ephemeral cloud HPC clusters.

## Day 2 - Building Software-defined-infrastructure Applications

Learn how to build software-defined-infrastructure applications. Use
continuous integration to manage infrastructure and learn how to 
incorporate infrastructre-as-code into your software development
skillset.

You will have a choice of one of four hackathons in the afternoon.
These will teach-by-doing by providing 
the opportunity to work with Bristol RSEs and AWS Solutions
Architects to tackle real software development challenges
in cloud. Choose from;

1. Build a solution to automatically profile and benchmark HPC workloads,
   with the aim of simplifying the process of choosing the best processor(s)
   to optimise cost versus performance.

2. Learn how to manage the AWS Spot Market by building support
   for spot into cluster-in-the-cloud. This will involve involve
   learning how to interact with the AWS API, and how to manage
   cloud instances in slurm and terraform.

3. Learn about and benchmark AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for high
   speed networking in HPC. This will involve adding support
   for EFA to cluster-in-the-cloud, during which you will learn how to build and 
   manage software-defined-networks in terraform, and then
   configure systems using ansible. Finally, benchmark your
   own applications to see how EFA improves scaling performance.

4. Implement a persistent high-performance shared storage 
   layer on top of compute fleets. Learn how to build
   and manage persistent storage, and how to connect to it
   from ephemeral clusters. Add support for persistent
   storage to cluster-in-the-cloud, and benchmark
   the performance of different storage solutions.

You are free to choose one of these workshops, or to continue your
work from day 1 to compile, profile, optimise and benchmark your
application across a range of different AWS hardware.
